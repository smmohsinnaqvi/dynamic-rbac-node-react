# Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Granular Permissions in Node.js and React
This goal focuses on implementing a dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in a Node.js and Express.js backend with a React frontend, ensuring granular permission management. Permissions are dynamically configurable, allowing real-time updates to user access across different roles (e.g., Admin, User, Visitor). The backend enforces access control via middleware, while the frontend restricts UI elements (such as navigation tabs) and redirects unauthorized users. This ensures a scalable and maintainable security model where role-based access can be modified without code changes, reflecting instantly in the application.
